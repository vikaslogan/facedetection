# Face Detection
We will build a face & eyes detection program. (Green Squares: Face,  Blue Squares: Eyes)

For this program, we will use OpenCV library.

We can use this program to secure our data and items by face recognition security and it can also be used for finding lost persons.

Detailed explaination is given in Explaination.docx file to understand the code.

Source Code is available in facedetection.py file

Install OpenCV module before compiling code using "pip install opencv-python" command in cmd.
